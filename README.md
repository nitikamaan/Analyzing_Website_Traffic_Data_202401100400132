# Website Traffic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes website traffic data using Python. We extract meaningful insights by processing a dataset 
containing page views, session durations, bounce rates, and traffic sources.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your dataset (`website_traffic.csv`) in the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Nitika_202401100400132.ipynb`.
4. Run all the cells to generate insights and visualizations.

## Output
The notebook generates various charts, including:
- Website traffic trends over time.
- Traffic source distribution.
- Bounce rate analysis.
- Average session duration by day.
